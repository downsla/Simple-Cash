# Simple-Cash
COSC 4310 Computer Architecture - Cache Project 11/15/2020

Implement a Simple Cache with set associativity options for direct-mapped, set associative (2-way/4-way) (LRU replacement policy), and fully associative (LRU replacement policy) using JAVA or C++.

The Simple Cache should be able to take inputs â€“ Number of cache blocks, set associativity option and a sequence of block address references and print out corresponding cache miss rate and cache content for each reference.

Based on attached Cache example (Cache and Cache Solution) - Testing:
  1. Input: Number of cache blocks, set associativity option, replacement policy option, and block address reference for each set associativity.
  2. Output: Cache miss rate and content for each set associativity option.
